            <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
            <p>
                The dominance of mobile internet use means that users 
                are searching for the right business as they travel, 
                shop, or sit on their couch at home. Search Engine 
                Optimization (SEO) allows you to increase your 
                visibility and find the right customers for your 
                business.

            <h2>Online Reputation Management</h2>
            <p>
                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be 
                negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet 
                connection to say whatever they want about your business. Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.

            <h2>Social Media Marketing</h2>
            <p>
                Social media continues to have a sizable influence on 
                buying habits. Social media marketing helps you 
                determine which platforms are suited to your brand, 
                using analytics to find the right markets and increase 
                your lead generation.

            />
            <p>
                Inbound strategies for lead generation require less 
                work for your business, bringing customers directly
                to your website.

            <p>
                Users find your business through paid and organic 
                searches, increasing the search ranking and 
                visibility for your business.

            <p>
                As the search ranking for your business increases, 
                your advertising costs decrease, and you no longer 
                need to advertise your page.
