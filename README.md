# Project Title: 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description: 
A marketing agency has Hired me to ensure that people with disabilities are able to properly access their existing website by refactoring the given code. 

A number of considerations are keyboard accessibility, good positioning in web search engines, and clear concise labels. 

I have built this project to better understand how CSS can be condensed for clearer understanding and less unnecessary code, or repetitions. 
To understand the use of semantics within the code for clearer definitions and web browser access. 
I hope to have solved the issues surrounding unlabelled Div tags, incorrectly working links and making sure that the web page is fully accessible to keyboard commands. 

I have learnt that while all the selectors in this project are class attributes, it is better practise to use ID attributes for unique styling targets within the Css. 
I have learnt how to upload a project from my computer onto GitHub using git Init and how to create a good README file for it.

## Installation: 
There should be no need to install the project as it is a web page, I am aiming to utilise git pages to create a working preview on GitHub, however you can download the files to your own machine to view the code. 

## Usage:
![Heading and logo image](assets/Screenshots/headerAndImage.jpg)   
The Link shown here "search engin optimization" was broken, I fixed this with an appropriate reference to the ID tag locater. 

![Example of css code showing a:hover](assets/Screenshots/aHover.JPG)  
I made the Nav bar links show up if hovered over incase of keyboard selection control being used for diability - shows selection. 

![Example of .managemnet class](assets/Screenshots/managementClass.JPG)  
![Example of .benifit class](assets/Screenshots/beniftClass.JPG)
These examples show combining css code that was repetitive of itself by implementing a single class to cover all instances.   
  
I have also included the use of em for the text sizing to make the text editable/scallable for disability use.   
  
Just to show another way to embed an image in markdown:

## Road Map:
I have only solved the issues that have been highlighted to me by the project brief, there are other issues with the web page such as rescaling the browser window. These issues can be resolved with responsive web pages and media quires to accommodate different browser sizes. 

## Credits:
Collaborators on the project include:
 * Colum Lynagh for helping to check my work and provide guidance. 
   * Git to Github produced some hidden commits that provented me from pushing new work to github via the terminal, Colum helped me to diagnose the issue and we used git push a couple for times to clear the additional commits before commiting my changes. 
   I did have to redo my changes to my README.md file.
